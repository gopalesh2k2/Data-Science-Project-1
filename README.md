The given dataset is a time series data and we need to fit a model that can predict the output with high accuracy. I have used a Random Forest Regressor in order to predcit the values for paragraph 9, 10, 11, 12. A Random forest regressor makes use of n number of decision trees and average the values of output of each decision tree to get a final output.
